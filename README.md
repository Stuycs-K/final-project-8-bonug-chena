## Overview
We are trying to recreate the Minesweeper game. A randomly generated map with mines will be created. Based on where the mines are, numbers will be placed on the map. The two actions of the player are to place down flags and dig. The flags represent mines and the dig is when the player believes itâ€™s a safe space.

## Instructions
In order to dig on a square, you can mouse click on it. It will reveal a number which represents the number of mines adjacent to that square.
If you want to place a flag down, you can toggle the flag button, which will turn green when it's activated. If you wan to remove a flag, you can toggle the deflag button,
which will turn green when it's activated. You don't need to turn off the flag placer to use the deflagger(deflagger overrides).  
If you want to restart the game, you can click the "new game" button.
If you want to change the difficulty, you can press the difficulty button, which toggles between the three levels.
The flags left represents how many flags you can still place down, but the number will decrease regardless of whether or not the flags are placed correctly.
